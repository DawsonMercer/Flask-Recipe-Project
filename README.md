# How to use this flask app.

## Steps:
### 1. Download/pull all of the code in this repo.
### 2. Once you add the code to a new project, navigate to the terminal and write "flask run", this will open a local version of the website on your machine. 
### 3. In the terminal, you may have to install flask_wtf, flask_bcrpyt, flask_wtf, flask_sqlalchemy, and flask_login as for some reason I was unable to create a virtual environment.
### 4. Uploading a file will add it to the CSV folder which in turn will add the recipe to the website (locally)
### 5. You may create an account or sign in as there is a user database for hanlding log-ins.
